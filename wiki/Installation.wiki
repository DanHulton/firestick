#summary How to install firestick

*Please ensure you use the .zip linked on the Project Home to install.*  The code in the Source tab is the full testing/development install.

= Extracting the source =

Simply extract the zip file into your /application directory.  The files are already in the appropriate subfolders.

= Creating the template table =

Run the "create.sql" script as a user with schema create privileges.  You may alter the database name (default "logs") if you wish to store your performance logs in a different database.

Make sure to grant all privileges on this database to your database users for your application.

= Configuration =

 * Open /application/config/firestick.php and alter to your heart's content.  If you changed the database name when you created the template table, ensure you change "db_name" now.
 * Locate and change "$config['enable_hooks'] = FALSE;" in your config/config.php to "$config['enable_hooks'] = true;"
 * Add the following to your config/hooks.php:
{{{
$hook['post_system'] = array(
    'class'    => 'Firestick',
    'function' => 'resolve_profiling',
    'filename' => 'Firestick.php',
    'filepath' => 'libraries'
);
}}}
