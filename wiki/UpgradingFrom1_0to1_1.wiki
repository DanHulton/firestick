=== Upgrading the source ===

Simply extract the zip file into your /application directory.  The files are already in the appropriate subfolders.

=== Upgrading the database tables ===

Run firestick-upgrade-1.0-1.1.sql.  If you wish to upgrade any logging tables (today's is a good idea), just change the table name to that day's logging table's name.  Ensure that if you use a different database than "logs" you alter that in the upgrade script.

The upgraded tables can be used with old versions of Firestick, as they only add columns.

=== Configuration ===

 * Add the following two hooks to your config/hooks.php:
{{{
$hook['post_controller_constructor'] = array(
    'class'    => 'Firestick',
    'function' => 'pre_application',
    'filename' => 'Firestick.php',
    'filepath' => 'libraries'
);

$hook['post_controller'] = array(
    'class'    => 'Firestick',
    'function' => 'post_application',
    'filename' => 'Firestick.php',
    'filepath' => 'libraries'
);
}}}
